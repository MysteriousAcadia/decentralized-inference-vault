# DIV Frontend - Decentralized Inference Vault

A React/Next.js frontend for the Decentralized Inference Vault (DIV) platform - the first commission-free, token-gated Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) inference platform.

## üöÄ Features

- **Landing Page**: Comprehensive overview of DIV's capabilities and architecture
- **Model Marketplace**: Browse and purchase access to AI models through DAO tokens
- **Inference Interface**: Submit requests to AI models with real-time chat interface
- **Model Upload**: Deploy your own AI models with encryption and token-gating
- **Dashboard**: Monitor model performance, revenue, and token holders
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless Web3 wallet connection via Rainbow Kit
- **Multi-chain Support**: Built for Polygon with cross-chain capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Web3 Integration**: Rainbow Kit + Wagmi + Viem
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (with Polygon Amoy testnet support)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The frontend integrates with three key decentralized infrastructure components:

1. **Lighthouse**: Encrypted storage and token-gated access control
2. **Fluence Network**: Serverless compute for AI inference
3. **Synapse Protocol**: Cross-chain USDC payments

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
